Reflecting on Principle
1) How are Ruby modules (and similar features from other langs)
   different from a class, in their purpose?
  they are designed to hold functions that are related to many different classes that are not related themselves. 
2) What is LSP?
    Liskov Substitution Principle. Basically and subclass must be a sutible substitution for its superclass
3) Briefly describe how the template method pattern works.
    The template method pattern works by creating a hook that the subclass can use to overwrite it own data into.
    Basically the superclass implements a method that the subclasses have different values for.
